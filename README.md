# FOMiningScript
Very simple and somewhat broken script that was design to be used in Fonline Reloaded server, and probably won't work properly with any other.
It might as well not work with different HUDs, if you're not wearing combat armor, etc. It's very specific, the requirements can be seen well in a
complimentary folder with PNG files, where you can see what exactly the script is looking for.

Makes your character(who's assumingly wearing a combat armor) search around the mine(like 1.5 screen) 
on exactly 71% zoom for iron and then, if he doesn't find any - mineral veins.

Then when your character is carrying too much(you've got overweight status on your screen) he proceeds to dump all the minerals
into a brahmin facing south-west, iirc.

It might break when there's no ore to find, if there's some really bad and weird lightning(grayscale setting should be helping
with that, but afaik it's not 100% reliable.

Myself i've mined a ton of materials with this thing, but it was for testing purposes and i have no intention on either playing
FOnline or developing the script any further, although a very simple and efficient design is possible to achieve.

Please, keep in mind that this was my first real project on python, so it's a mess, i can code so much better now.
